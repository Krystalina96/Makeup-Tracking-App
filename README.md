# Makeup Stash App

For the makeup enthusiast who wants to keep track of their makeup stash, this makeup tracking app allows the user to track and sort their inventory as well as different looks they create with their products.

The primary stakeholders are poeple who really enjoy makeup and have a large collection as well as people who have only what they need and use it more sparingly. People will the large collection can use it to keep track of what they have so they don't buy duplicates, and people who have only what they need would use it more to track expiration dates and know what shades to buy when repurchasing.
